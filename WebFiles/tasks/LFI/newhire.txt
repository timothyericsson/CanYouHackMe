First of all, safety is our top priority. Bananas may look harmless, but they can be quite slippery and dangerous if not handled properly. That's why you must always wear your protective gear, such as gloves, goggles, and a helmet. And don't forget to tie your shoelaces, or you might end up on the floor with a bunch of bananas on top of you.

Secondly, quality is our second priority. We only accept the best bananas from our suppliers, and we expect you to treat them with respect and care. That means no bruising, peeling, or eating the bananas while on the job. And don't even think about throwing them around like monkeys. We have cameras everywhere, and we'll catch you if you do.

Thirdly, efficiency is our third priority. We have a lot of bananas to process every day, and we need you to work fast and smart. That means no slacking, chatting, or napping on the job. And don't waste time looking for the perfect banana. They're all perfect in their own way. Just grab one and move on.
