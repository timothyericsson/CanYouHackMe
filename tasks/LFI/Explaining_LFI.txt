1. we call /etc/passwd using lfi
We see banana_user

Get login. 

We could also get a shell from calling a PHP file if we found a way to upload files.
 


//extra
The code we are abusing in LFI usually looks like this

$file = $_GET['page'];
require($file);

Sometimes, however, the code might look like this

$file = $_GET['page'];
require($file . ".php");

The php is added to the filename, this will mean that we will not be able to find the files we are looking for. Since the file /etc/passwd.php does not exist. However, if we add the nullbyte to the end of our attack-string the .php will not be taken into account. So we add %00 to the end of our attack-string.

http://example.com/page=../../../../../../etc/passwd%00
This technique is usually called the nullbyte technique since %00 is the nullbyte. The technique only works in versions below php 5.3.
