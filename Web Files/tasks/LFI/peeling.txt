Peeling a banana may seem like a simple task, but there's more to it than meets the eye. If you want to peel a banana like a pro, follow these steps:

1. Hold the banana in your dominant hand, with the stem facing up. Don't hold it too tightly, or you might squish it.
2. Locate the small brown spot at the bottom of the banana. This is the weak point of the peel, and the easiest place to start.
3. Use your thumb or index finger to gently push on the spot and create a small tear in the peel. Don't use your nails, or you might damage the fruit.
4. Peel back the flap of peel and pull it down along the curve of the banana. Don't peel it all the way off, or you might drop it.
5. Repeat with the other three flaps of peel until you have a naked banana in your hand. Don't forget to peel off any stringy bits that might be stuck to the banana.
6. Place the prepared banana into the banana processing machine.
